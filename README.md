## To build

Make sure Android Studio and the Android SDK are installed, and open this project in Android Studio.
Android studio will automatically install required packages and libraries.
Let the project build and accept any download prompts from Android Studio.

## To run

This project only supports devices with an Android SDK of 23 or higher, which means Android version 6.0 (Released 2015) or above.
Attach an adroid device of appropriate software version to your dev machine and enable dev-mode and then debugging on the Android device.
See [Androids guide on enabling Dev-mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) for more information on configuring developer options.
Once debugging is enabled on the phone/tablet, press "Run App" and Android studio should detect the connected device and display it as an option to run on.
Select that device and press "OK" and Android Studio will likely prompt to download the necessary SDK for  that phone, do this and allow Android Studio to run code on the connected device.
